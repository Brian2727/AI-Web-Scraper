Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-web-scraper.git
cd ai-web-scraper
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your environment variables (for API keys or cloud credentials):

bash
Copy code
export API_KEY=yourapikey
export CLOUD_CREDENTIALS=yourcredentials
Usage
Start the Streamlit UI:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run ui.py
Input the target URL into the interface and select what data points you want to scrape.

The app will use Selenium to control the browser, and BeautifulSoup will parse and clean the HTML.

Process data with LLM: The cleaned data is sent to the LLM for contextual understanding, and the results are displayed in the UI.

Key Features
Part 1: User Interface
Built using Streamlit for rapid development and ease of use.
Users can input URLs and select specific data points for extraction, making the app user-friendly and highly accessible.
Part 2: Web Scraping
Selenium automates the browser to access dynamic web content.
BeautifulSoup parses HTML and removes irrelevant elements (scripts, styles) for better data processing.
Part 3: AI Integration
Uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to process and interpret the cleaned web data.
Batches HTML data for efficient memory usage during LLM processing.
Future Enhancements
CAPTCHA Handling: Explore ethical methods to bypass simple CAPTCHA systems.
User-Friendly Dashboard: Improve the UI to include data visualization and export options.
Advanced LLM Models: Further integration of more advanced LLMs for deeper analysis.
