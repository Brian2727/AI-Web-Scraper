## Key Features
# Part 1: User Interface
- Built using Streamlit for rapid development and ease of use.
- Users can input URLs and select specific data points for extraction, making the app user-friendly and highly accessible.
# Part 2: Web Scraping
- Selenium automates the browser to access dynamic web content.
- BeautifulSoup parses HTML and removes irrelevant elements (scripts, styles) for better data processing.
# Part 3: AI Integration
- Uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to process and interpret the cleaned web data.
- Batches HTML data for efficient memory usage during LLM processing.
# Future Enhancements
- CAPTCHA Handling: Explore ethical methods to bypass simple CAPTCHA systems.
- User-Friendly Dashboard: Improve the UI to include data visualization and export options.
- Advanced LLM Models: Further integration of more advanced LLMs for deeper analysis.
